This project is done to try and examine the sentiment on multiple subreddits. 
This script needs to be set up with the reddit api, a mySQL DB (run locally), windows schedular (could easily be set up with something else similar) and an email account for reporting errors. 

All variables can be manipulated as you wish to try and get the best result. 

The script saves the daily analysis in a csv and is also added to the database.
