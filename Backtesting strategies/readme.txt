An attempt to test the probability of hitting a stock that would produce positive returns if one could only invest in one stock. 

This test does not take the bankrupt firms into account and does thereby not return a valid answer. 

The test does also run incredible slow and takes hours to finish. 
A solution for the runtime could be to implement a low-level-language for the calculations. 
This I might do at some point
